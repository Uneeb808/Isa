jccuISA(INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE)-SET OF INSTRUCTIONS UNDERSTOOD AND EXECUTED BY PROCESSOR (interface bw software and hardware)
Architecture of processors.
 OF 2 TYPES-
CISC-COMPLEX INFSTRUCTION SET COMPUTER
HANDLES LARGE INSTRUCTIONS (ALL INSTR AT ONCE WHICH INCREASES CLOCK CYCLE).eg-x64,AMD
RISC-REDUCED INSTR SET COMPUTER
HANDLES SIMPLIFIED AND SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
ONE AT A TIME.MORE EFFICIENT AND LESS POWER IS CONSUMED(USED IN MOBILE PHONES).eg-ARM
  





RISC V - AN OPEN SOURCE ISA. SAME CHARACTERISTICS AS RISC


KERNEL- COMMUNICATION B/W HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THROUGH A SYSTEM CALL.(CPU AND HARD DISK).KERNEL REQUIRES LOW LEVEL LANGUAGE FOR EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION.device drivers


DNS-DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM.CONVERTS A DOMAIN NAME TO IP ADDRESS.EG-WWW.XYZ.COM,gmail.com


REGISTERS-SMALL HIGH SPEED STORAGE LOCATIONS TO STORE DATA TEMPORARILY.


VOLATILE MEMORY-IS LOST WHEN PC TURNED OFF(ram,registers).EG-BRAVE BROWSER RESTORES TAB.
IT STORES INITIALLY ON RAM BUT AFTER OFF ITS TRASNFERRED TO NON VOL MEMORY




HDD STORES DATA MAGNETICALLY ON A ROTATING (HARD DISK).STORES FOR A LONGER TIME THAN SSD WHICH STORES ELECTRONICALLY(SMALL AMOUNT OF CHARGE).HDD REQUIRES POWER ONLY ONCE.SSD SMALL AND FASTER.


SWITCH-eg- router can be connected to computer by switch.CONNECTS AND TRANSFERS DATA PACKETS BETWEEN DEVICES (OSI LAYER 2)AND router directs data packets to less traffic routes(OSI LAYER 3). Router also does MODEM WORk.ONCE THE DATA PROCESSED BY ROUTER SWITCH JUST TRANSFERS IT.ROUTER CAN ALSO DO SWITCH’S ROLE.router forwards/routes the packets.
Switch handles the data traffick
#no router no wifi/network
###Modulation:
Digital to Analog Conversion: Modems convert digital signals generated by computers or other digital devices into analog signals suitable for transmission over analog communication channels, such as telephone lines.






The "Swap" row in the output of the free command provides information about the swap space on your system. Swap space is a designated area on a storage device (usually a hard disk or SSD) that the operating system uses as virtual memory when the physical RAM is full.The concept of swap space is used to extend the effective size of the system's memory. When the physical RAM is fully utilized, the operating system can move less frequently used data from RAM to the swap space, freeing up space in RAM for more active processes. 


CACHE MEMORY- VOLATILE.STORES FREQUENTLY ACCESSED APPS,DATA.REDUCES TIME TO ACCES THE DATA


Ethernet port-connects the router and computer to transfer data(within lan)


Wan port- it connects the pc to the internet


Mac address-12 alphanumerics.given to every part that helps in data communication like switch router printers speakers router etc in a network.(given to nic).osi layer 2


Ip address-  Not to a cpu,memory, hard drive or memory.only to device that helps in data communication(same like mac address) like nic switch router.osi layer 3
Ipv4,ipv6. Assigned by an isp.
1)static
2)dynamic(changes over time)  
#local ip-within a local network
Private ip-home devices phones,pc,printer.not visible to others
Public ip-public servers like public wifi,gmail,amazon,whatsappetc






Nic- connects a network with a computer. Comes at osi layer 2 after osi at layer 3 routes the data.so it allows the data to enter the system after some routing and examination.




Digital signal- 0s and 1s binary.do not get affected by sound and temp
Analog signal -  some physical qty is made varying to graph it

#containers do not require hypervisor they run on a os


Hypervisor-creates and runs the vms.its a software
Type 1-bare metal. The hypervisor contains the software requirements. Its made only on a bare metal hardware .no host os present only hardware and hypervisor.direct  access to hardware.(firmware)
Type2- built in a computer already having a host os. A new vm is created for running the  new os
Type 1 require less resources and has better performance. 
##while type 1 has direct acces to hardware type 2 doesnt rather the host os is an intermediate between hypervisor and hardware so type 2 has very indirect access




⇒vm’s run and manage a whole machine while containers only have dependencies and configurations for an app.A Vm has an ip address different than the host machine to for better communication from servers and between vms.


⇒server-its a computer/system that provides services and resources over a network to computers(clients).they have all the database and transfer the data to clients.

Let's use an analogy to explain virtual memory:
Imagine a Desk with Papers:
   * Physical Desk Space (RAM):
   * Think of your physical desk space as your computer's RAM (Random Access Memory).
   * You have limited space on your desk to work on tasks (running programs).
   * Infinite Desk Extension (Virtual Memory):
   * Now, imagine an infinite extension of your desk, representing virtual memory.
   * This extension can hold more papers (data and code) than your physical desk.
   * Page Table (Desk Organizer):
   * Your desk organizer is like the page table managed by the operating system.
   * It helps you keep track of which papers are on your physical desk and which are on the infinite extension.
   * Page Fault (Missing Paper):
   * When you need a paper that's not on your physical desk, you refer to your desk organizer.
   * If it's in the infinite extension, you fetch it. This is like a page fault.
   * Swapping Papers (Disk Space):
   * If your physical desk is full, you might move some papers to a filing cabinet (disk space).
   * Swapping papers between your desk and the cabinet is similar to moving data between RAM and disk.
   * Efficient Space Usage:
   * The desk plus the extension (RAM plus virtual memory) allows you to work on more tasks efficiently.
   * You can always access any paper, but you don't need all of them on your desk at once.
In summary, virtual memory is like having an infinite desk extension (beyond physical RAM) to manage more papers (data and code) efficiently. The page table (desk organizer) keeps track of where everything is, and swapping papers between the desk and filing cabinet (disk) helps you make the most of your desk space.


Let's use the analogy of sending physical letters and the client-server model to explain why WhatsApp Pay is peer-to-peer (P2P).


### Analogy: Sending Physical Letters


Imagine you and your friends regularly exchange letters. Each person has their own mailbox, and you can drop a letter directly into your friend's mailbox. This is akin to peer-to-peer communication because you interact directly with your friends without involving intermediaries.


Now, let's extend this analogy to the client-server model:


### Analogy: Client-Server Model


1. **Client-Server Model:**
   - Think of a traditional postal service where you write a letter (the client), and you send it to a central post office (the server). The post office then routes the letter to your friend's mailbox.
   - In this model, you rely on an intermediary (the post office or server) to facilitate the communication between you and your friend.


2. **WhatsApp Pay as P2P:**
   - Now, let's introduce WhatsApp Pay. With WhatsApp Pay, you can think of each person having their own "digital mailbox" within the WhatsApp app. When you want to send money, you can directly transfer it from your "mailbox" to your friend's "mailbox" without involving an external intermediary (like a bank).


3. **Comparison:**
   - **Client-Server (Traditional Banking):**
     - *Process:* You visit a bank (server) to send money. The bank facilitates the transaction and updates both your and your friend's accounts.
     - *Analogous to:* Using a central post office to send a letter.


   - **P2P (WhatsApp Pay):**
     - *Process:* You initiate a payment directly from your WhatsApp app (client) to your friend's WhatsApp app (peer). WhatsApp facilitates the transaction, but it doesn't involve external banking infrastructure for P2P transactions.
     - *Analogous to:* Dropping a letter directly into your friend's mailbox.


### Key Points:


- **P2P Analogy:** In the P2P scenario, the direct exchange between individuals resembles sending letters directly to each other's mailboxes.


- **Client-Server Analogy:** In the client-server scenario, the intermediary (bank or post office) facilitates the communication and processing of the transaction.


- **WhatsApp Pay:** By being P2P, WhatsApp Pay allows users to send money directly to each other within the app, similar to sending letters directly to friends' mailboxes without involving external postal services.


Both client-server and P2P models have their advantages and use cases, and the choice depends on factors such as efficiency, trust, and the nature of the transaction. P2P models like WhatsApp Pay often emphasize direct user interactions and simplicity in financial transactions.


No, hashed and encrypted are not the same, although both are cryptographic techniques used to protect data. Here's how they differ:


### Hashing:


- **Purpose:** Hashing is a one-way function used to generate a fixed-size string of characters (hash value) from input data of any size.
- **Irreversibility:** Hashing is irreversible, meaning you cannot retrieve the original input data from the hash value.
- **Deterministic:** For the same input data, a hash function always produces the same hash value.
- **Use Cases:** Hashing is commonly used for password storage, data integrity verification, and generating unique identifiers (e.g., hash tables, digital signatures).
- **Example Algorithms:** MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.


### Encryption:


- **Purpose:** Encryption is a reversible process used to encode plaintext data into ciphertext using an encryption algorithm and a secret key.
- **Reversibility:** Encryption is reversible, meaning you can decrypt the ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the decryption algorithm and the same secret key.
- **Confidentiality:** Encryption ensures confidentiality by preventing unauthorized parties from accessing the original data without the decryption key.
- **Use Cases:** Encryption is commonly used for securing sensitive data during transmission or storage, such as in secure communication protocols (HTTPS, SSL/TLS), disk encryption, and database encryption.
- **Example Algorithms:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), DES (Data Encryption Standard).


### Differences:


1. **Reversibility:** Hashing is irreversible, while encryption is reversible.
2. **Use Cases:** Hashing is typically used for data integrity and identification, while encryption is used for data confidentiality.
3. **Output Size:** Hash functions produce fixed-size hash values, while encryption algorithms may produce ciphertext of variable length.
4. **Security Properties:** Encryption provides confidentiality through the use of secret keys, while hashing provides data integrity and verification but does not offer confidentiality.
5. **Collision Resistance:** A good hash function should have low collision probability (i.e., producing different hash value for different input data), whereas encryption algorithms aim to prevent decryption without the proper key, regardless of collisions.


In summary, while both hashing and encryption are cryptographic techniques used to protect data, they serve different purposes and have distinct properties and use cases.

System design
P2p
HTTP/2-
Revised version of HTTP1, a network protocol used www.
Developed by HTTP working group of the internet engineering task force(ietf)
The standardization effort is supported by Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, Safari, Amazon Silk, and Edge browsers
HTTP/2 introduces a new framing layer that allows multiple requests and responses to be sent and received in parallel over a single TCP connection
HTTP/2 uses a binary framing format instead of plain text, which was used in HTTP/1.1. This binary format is more efficient to parse and reduces overhead, resulting in faster processing and improved performance.
Server Push: HTTP/2 introduces server push, a feature that allows the server to send resources to the client proactively, without waiting for the client to request them explicitly. This capability can improve page load times by allowing the server to push critical resources (e.g., images, scripts) to the client before they are requested.
stream Prioritization: HTTP/2 supports stream prioritization, allowing clients to specify the relative importance of different resources. This feature enables more efficient resource allocation and can improve the overall user experience


Websockets-
WebSockets is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex, bidirectional communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time data transfer between clients and servers.


W3C(World Wide Web Consortium)-
A community who work together to make rules for how websites should work. This help web developers to create websites following the guidelines for it to be used.


RFC(request for comments)-RFCs are documents published by the IETF that describe various aspects of the internet, including protocols, procedures, and best practices. They cover topics like how data is transmitted over the internet, how emails are sent, and how web pages are accessed. RFCs are like the instruction manuals for how different parts of the internet work.


European Telecommunications Standards Institute-
ETSI develops standards and specifications for a wide range of ICT technologies. These standards cover areas such as telecommunications, broadcasting, networking, cybersecurity 
NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology)-
It develops and maintains standards, guidelines, and best practices in various fields, including cybersecurity, information technology, manufacturing, and metrology (the science of measurement). 


























   1. Http not secure but https secure bcz it has encryption and tls certificate which secures communication between s and c.
   2. Bin folder -(contains executable non human readable files necessary for app to run) Many software applications create a "bin" folder during installation to store executable files and related binaries. These files are essential for the proper functioning of the application.
   3. Microservices- dividing the application or software into small independent services, so that resources are allocated according to the demand of the services  monolithic architecture- all the application/software stored and processed at a single place(not divided unified).it has a centralised system.
   4. Microservices are decoupled that means they are independent and changes in one wont effect the working of other.
Hence instead of scaling the whole application its services can be scaled with demand.This is done by using virtualization(vms) and containers to get maximum output from the server. Each of these containers have a microservice, these containers are managed and deployed by k8s. Microservices communicate through api s.
API-set of protocols and rules used by k8s clusters to communicate with each other by client-server architecture. Its the interface between control plane and worker nodes.
a RESTful API allows clients to access and manipulate resources (e.g., data, files, services) on a server using standard HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). The term "REST" emphasizes the architectural principles of simplicity, scalability, and uniformity in designing web services
K8s cluster consists of-
1)control plance node-
Api server- it controls the state of the cluster (means the cluster works in the ways specified in its configurations and resources).
Controller manager- control the state of the cluster ensure it remains in the working state.eg-if 1 node goes down it replaces it
Scheduler-assigns workload to worker nodes based on available resources
Etcd-stores configuration data
2)worker nodes-
   * Kubelet: Ensures that containers are running in a Pod. It communicates with the control plane.
   * Container Runtime: Software responsible for running containers, such as Docker or containerd.
   * Kube Proxy: Maintains network rules and allows communication across Pods in the cluster.
   * Pod: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers. Provides shared resources and storage


Rpc = communication bw microservices
Network proxy- an intermediate server that sits between clients and servers for communication between them.It improves privacy, security, and performance in the process.provides load balancing
Gateway-interconnects 2 networks .basically a network proxy that doesnt modify data and communications. Though it does do security checks and routing(traffic manage).
Cryptography-securing a message(data) while communicating data.eg-dots/stars in password. The readable text is converted to symbols or codes.used in blockchains


P2p networking=its a decentralised network of computers where data and its processing is distributed among the nodes. A node can act both as a server and client and hence they share and communicate data with each other.eg-decentralised computers and distributed computers


system design serves as a blueprint or detailed plan for developing an information system. It provides a comprehensive view of how the various components and modules of the system will be organized, how they will interact, and how data will be stored and processed. The design addresses different aspects of the system, including its architecture, data structures, user interfaces, and more.


rpc - they are a set of protocols used for communication between microservices.based on the client and server architecture. Function running on a client is executed on another remote machine. The client sends a request for this.client=caller   server=executer
eg-grpc 
They also have protocol buffers for language agnostic encoding of data and instructions.




whatsapp-  


It uses protocols like-


MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)
DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)


Uses nosql databases for scaling and dealing with the dynamic nature of the app.


Uses tokens for authentication of users


Web sockets for transfer of data and communication between user and server.


on installation, it creates a user account using the user's phone number as the username 


Uses opus for voice calls


Presence servers for online/offline status of the user
WhatsApp Payments (marketed as WhatsApp Pay) is a peer-to-peer money transfer feature


Uses end-end encryption where message can only be decrypted by the receiver.a special encryption key is given to both to authenticate the decryption of the message.






Netflix-


  



Netflix main servers=US


Netflix is known for its loosely coupled and highly scalable microservice architecture.


To make the videos viewable on different devices, Netflix performs transcoding or encoding, which involves finding errors and converting the original video into different formats and resolutions.
Netflix offers a unified API aggregation layer at the edge(uses edge computing)The aggregation layer can handle tasks such as routing requests, data transformation, and combining responses from various APIs.




  







multiple APIs are brought together and presented through a single interface.




But for large market like india it has cache servers(open connect) in that country.The main servers from Usa send the video data(mp4 files) to the cache.


It uses adaptive bitrate streaming.eg-higher video quality for larger devices like laptops tv


When the request arrives at the endpoint it calls the other microservices for required data and these microservices can also request the data from different microservices. After that, a complete response for the API request is sent back to the endpoint. 


ELB in Netflix is responsible for routing the traffic to front-end services. ELB performs a two-tier load-balancing scheme where the load is balanced over zones first and then instances (servers).


ZUUL is a gateway service that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, and security. It provides easy routing based on query parameters, URL, and path








UBER-


Earlier Uber was built on the “monolithic” software architecture model.
Uber uses the Google S2 library. DISCO divides the map into tiny cells with a unique ID to each cell(cells are for example 3km) 
All the active cabs keep on sending the location to the server once every 4 seconds through a web application firewall and load balancer
Demand service receives the request of the cab through a web socket and it tracks the GPS location of the user. It also receives different kinds of requirements such as the number of seats, type of car, or pool car.
These tiny cells’ responsibilities will be divided into different servers lies in multiple regions (consistent hashing).
The dispatch system (including supply, demand, and web socket) is built on NodeJS. NodeJS is the asynchronous and event-based framework that allows you to send and receive messages through WebSockets whenever you want.


Ringpop uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol to make calls from one server to another server.
Ringpop also uses a SWIM membership protocol/gossip protocol that allows independent workers to discover each other’s responsibilities. This way each server/node knows the responsibility and the work of other nodes.
Redis for both caching and queuing. Some are behind Twemproxy (which provides scalability of the caching layer). Some are behind a custom clustering system.
by using drivers' phones as a source of trip data and sending encrypted state digests, Uber ensures that even in the event of a data center failure, the backup data center can quickly get the latest trip information from the driver's phone app






CHAT GPT-


Uses llm(large language model).


  

To scale the system to millions of users, we need to implement some optimizations


Load balancers


Horizontal scaling


Data partitioning allows splitting conversation data by bot type or user groups. This limits data sizes for higher performance.
Cache memory




User enters text in the chat widget on the frontend and hits send. This triggers a request.
The request is sent to the backend application layer. It contains the user input text, user ID, conversation context, etc.
The application layer handles parsing the input, extracting key entities and intent. It adds metadata like the user ID and bot profile.
The request is routed to the appropriate bot model based on the user's chosen bot or context. This handles scaling to different model instances.
The model analyzes the input text using techniques like attention to identify relevant context. It generates a response text word-by-word using the conditional language model.
The raw response text is sent back to the application layer. Here additional formatting is applied to display it properly in the chat interface. Images/links can also be inserted if needed.
The formatted response is returned to the user's chat screen and displayed. Websocket connection enables real-time updates.
